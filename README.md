# Neural_Network_MLB_Pitch_Classification

Check out the pdf file to view the project!


In this project, I will be using a neural network to predict the pitch type of MLB pitches thrown between 2015-2018, based on the advanced metrics caputred by the high quality Statcast cameras, such as the spin rate of the pitch, the movement in the vertical and horizontal
directions, the angle of break on the pitch, and much more. I sourced this data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pschale/mlb-pitch-data-20152018/discussion?sort=undefined). As an avid fan of baseball, I thought this question posed the perfect oppurtunity to 
delve into the world of deep learning and the PyTorch Deep Learning Library with a hands on project in an area of interest; clearly, the type of pitch thrown is heavily correlated with the movement charecteristics of the ball, and a neural network can definitelty capture 
this relationship.
